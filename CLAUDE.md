# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository. For a project overview see
`README.md`; for domain vocabulary see `CONTEXT.md`; for past architectural decisions
see `docs/adr/`.

## Development

- **Install (framework)**: `uv sync --extra lab` — installs the `lab` extra + the
  `dev` group (pytest). Corpus-prep only needs `uv sync`.
- **Run tests**: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest` (pytest reads `src/` via
  `pythonpath` in `pyproject.toml`). The heavy bge-m3 smoke test is skipped unless
  `RAG_LAB_SMOKE=1` is set.
- **CLI** (needs `PYTHONPATH=src`): `python -m rag_lab.cli run --config
  config/experiments/dev_smoke.yaml` (batch build), or the low-level `build` /
  `retrieve` commands.
- **UI**: `.venv/Scripts/streamlit.exe run app/streamlit_app.py --server.fileWatcherType
  none` — Mode B (Query & Compare, the main script), Mode A (Build/Run,
  `app/pages/1_build_run.py`), and the Chunk Inspector (`app/pages/2_chunk_inspector.py`
  — visually compare how each chunker splits a document, and triage abnormally large
  chunks; reads `chunks.parquet` only, never `embeddings.npy`) in the sidebar nav. The
  `--server.fileWatcherType none` flag suppresses a harmless but noisy
  `ModuleNotFoundError: torchvision` warning: Streamlit's auto-reload watcher walks
  every loaded module's `__path__`, which triggers `transformers`' lazy-import
  machinery on unrelated submodules (e.g. `zoedepth`) that need optional deps we don't
  install. All three pages are thin shells over `rag_lab.query_service` /
  `rag_lab.runner` + `rag_lab.config` (the tested core); the widgets themselves are
  smoke-tested via `streamlit.testing.v1.AppTest`, not unit-tested individually.

## Conventions

- The core package `src/rag_lab/` must not import Streamlit (ADR-0001): keep it
  importable and unit-testable; UI/CLI are thin layers on top.
- Add a strategy by creating a file + registering it (`src/rag_lab/registry.py`);
  never edit the runner (Open/Closed).
- `Chunk.resolution_id` is load-bearing — relevance is judged at the Resolution level
  (ADR-0002).
- The corpus (`academic_resolutions/`) is gitignored and lives at the repo root;
  corpus-prep tooling in `tools/corpus_prep/` needs Poppler + Ollama.
- Corpus layout is `<ปี>/ครั้งที่ N/` (special sessions: `ครั้งที่ Ns`); per-meeting
  `meeting_manifest.json` is the metadata source of truth for titles/URLs — never
  encode metadata in filenames (ADR-0003). The reconciled inventory is
  `academic_resolutions/master_list.csv`.
- OCR-corruption remediation (LLM consensus scan + re-OCR + dual-model
  old-vs-new adjudication + write-back) lives in `tools/corpus_prep/`
  (`llm_ocr_scan.py`, `reocr_consensus_pages.py`, `reocr_adjudicate.py`,
  `reocr_apply.py`), with a review UI at `tools/corpus_prep/consensus_review/`
  (`streamlit run tools/corpus_prep/consensus_review/review_app.py`).
  Status/handoff: `docs/llm-ocr-scan-log.md`. Original 872-page
  consensus-AND-gate batch complete and written back (commit `b692480`,
  2026-07-16): 753/768 pages live, 18 kept old. **2026-07-25**: found one
  file the original scan had missed entirely (a coverage gap) — sized and
  found to actually be 2 separate mechanisms, not a simple gap: Mechanism A
  (consensus-threshold exclusion, 1,329 files/~47% of the corpus never
  touched by the AND-gate) and Mechanism B (a detection blind spot for
  massive single-character repetition, 2 severe files). A 100-page sample
  found only ~56% of phi4-only flags are real span-confirmed defects (not
  the ~83% raw new/new verdict rate — see `docs/llm-ocr-scan-log.md` §8 for
  why whole-page comparison overstates it). **2026-07-27**: user approved
  and ran the full Mechanism-A (kernel-A) remediation anyway, with explicit
  disclosure that the pipeline has no ground-truth-vs-source-image check —
  **complete**: 1,982 pages written across 393 files. The combined human-
  review queue (both batches) was then reduced 308→203→137→99→88 over 4
  rounds of evidence-based bulk decisions (length-delta, span-confirmation,
  independent-reOCR-agreement, table-repetition-signature) — see
  `docs/llm-ocr-scan-log.md` §9-§10 for the full methodology, including a
  key finding that re-OCR at temperature=0.0 is fully deterministic in this
  pipeline (a literal-repeat tie-break round reproduced its input
  byte-for-byte, so a later tie-break round was redesigned to genuinely
  perturb temperature/DPI instead). Remaining 88 pages need real human
  review. Mechanism B's 2 severe files (the LLM-detection blind spot —
  massive single-character repetition that neither model's garbled-prose
  check catches) are now **also fixed** (2026-07-27): re-OCR'd, adjudicated
  (unanimous new/new), applied, and verified clean by direct read.
- Entity tagging (person/program/course/faculty, all rule-based — regex
  anchored on a Thai academic rank or a curated dictionary, not NER; see
  `src/rag_lab/loaders/{person,program,course,faculty}_loader.py`) writes
  `metadata['people'|'programs'|'courses'|'faculties']`, consumed by the
  `entity_tags` loader + `entity_lookup`/`entity_boost` retrieval modes.
  Full narrative: `docs/entity-extraction-and-gold-eval-log.md`.
  **2026-07-25**: fixed a real gap in `match_people` — the bare "อ."
  academic rank (below ผศ./รศ./ศ., what most special/part-time instructors
  are cited with) had no title pattern at all, so plain-Thai instructor
  names in several common table types were invisible to tagging regardless
  of language (commit `a4e250e`; +10% people-tags corpus-wide, +37% in the
  document type that surfaced it). English-titled foreign-faculty names
  (Mr./Assoc.Prof.Dr.) and a name split across adjacent `<td>` cells are
  still unmatched — both deferred, user judged low priority/rare. The one
  index built with the `entity_tags` loader
  (`data/index/entity_tags_full`) needs rebuilding after any
  `person`/`program`/`course` loader change for the fix to reach
  `entity_lookup`/`entity_boost` in the UI.
- `strip_course_comparison_tables` (`src/rag_lab/loaders/common.py`, commit
  `71764a8`) compacts old/new course-comparison tables (code + credit-tuple
  + English description, the corpus's single largest chunks — 17,077 chars
  in one document) to `CODE Title` lines, dropping the description. **Not
  yet wired into any loader/config** — needs a thematic-inclusive eval
  before integration (course-name gold queries can't detect a
  description-stripping regression, since they never touch description
  text). Narrative: `docs/chunker-embedder-comparison-log.md` (course-table
  compaction section).
- Chunker/embedder/BM25/hybrid comparison eval lives in `tools/eval/`. Current (9-embedder)
  scripts: `run_gold_chunker_eval.py`, `run_gold_bm25_eval.py`, `run_gold_hybrid_eval.py` +
  `run_gold_hybrid_eval_9way_new.py`, `embedder_matrix_9way.py` (retrieval + breakdown +
  aggregate significance in one script — defines the `(type, model_name)`-keyed embedder
  labels and superseded-combo exclusions every other 9-way script imports),
  `embedder_significance_test_by_entity_type_9way.py`, `bm25_vs_embedder_significance_test_9way.py`,
  `hybrid_significance_test_9way.py`. (Originals without the `_9way` suffix cover only the
  first 6 embedders and are superseded but kept for reference.) Scores against the Gold query
  set `config/eval/gold_query_set_73det.yaml` (73 deterministic queries — use this one, not the
  252-entry `gold_query_set.yaml`, which dilutes results with low-discrimination thematic
  queries). Full process narrative: `docs/chunker-embedder-comparison-log.md`; clean
  citation-ready numbers for paper-writing: `docs/paper-results-summary.md` (update this one
  whenever a headline number changes — the log stays append-only). **Refreshed 2026-07-25**
  for the corpus-discovery contamination fix (0% contamination, see
  [[project_corpus_discovery_contamination_bug]] / `docs/chunker-embedder-comparison-log.md`,
  fix `8c86b63`/`b36f96f`/`dd0c0ae`, rebuild commit `2d36663`) — every conclusion held through
  that refresh. **Refreshed again 2026-07-29**, this time for a full second index rebuild
  (2026-07-28, unrelated OCR-remediation fix, [[project_reocr_remediation_pipeline]]) — and
  this refresh genuinely changed several conclusions below, not just numbers. A stale-cache
  incident is worth recording as its own lesson: `embedder_matrix_9way.py` recomputes
  dense-alone retrieval fresh every run, so dense-alone numbers refreshed automatically and
  correctly — but the BM25/hybrid persisted-results scripts
  (`run_gold_bm25_eval.py`/`run_gold_hybrid_eval.py`) were not re-invoked for 3 days, so
  every BM25/hybrid significance test kept silently comparing fresh dense numbers against
  stale (pre-rebuild) BM25/hybrid numbers until an implausible-looking batch of "flipped"
  findings prompted an mtime check. **Lesson: after any index rebuild, refresh every
  retrieval path with persisted results (dense, BM25, hybrid) — not only whichever one an
  eval script happens to recompute automatically.** Full incident:
  `docs/chunker-embedder-comparison-log.md`, "Re-eval หลัง OCR-remediation rebuild" entry.
  Current bottom line (2026-07-29, bootstrap + Holm-corrected, all 9 embedders,
  OCR-remediation-rebuilt indices):
  **`semantic` chunking + `hybrid` retrieval (BM25 + dense via RRF)** is still a defensible
  system-level recommendation, but the specific "semantic has the single best combo in the
  whole study" claim **no longer holds**: `semantic × qwen3_0.6b` recall@10 dropped from a
  stale 0.7048 to a fresh **0.6152**, and is no longer even the top chunker for that embedder —
  `sentence × qwen3_0.6b` now reads 0.6265 and `fixed_size × qwen3_0.6b` reads 0.6154, both
  numerically above `semantic`. No significance test exists yet for chunker-vs-chunker at a
  fixed embedder+retriever, so **don't cite `sentence` as the new winner either** — the honest
  state is "previously-cited semantic lead no longer visible, unadjudicated." Cross-chunker-averaged
  hybrid recall@10 (`qwen3_0.6b` 0.6167, `qwen3` 0.5945, `jina_v5` 0.5831, `e5` 0.5753,
  `bge-m3` 0.5730, `e5_small` 0.5658, `congen` 0.4692, `sct` 0.3939, `m2v` 0.3028). **The
  dedicated semantic-only top-5 pairwise tie test
  (`tools/eval/hybrid_significance_test_semantic_top5.py`) was re-run 2026-07-29** — the tie
  **partially broke**: `bge-m3` now loses significantly to `qwen3_0.6b`/`qwen3`/`jina_v5` on
  recall@10 and nDCG@10 (still ties all three on MRR) and drops out of the cluster. The
  remaining four (`qwen3_0.6b` 0.6152, `qwen3` 0.6051, `jina_v5` 0.5995, `e5_small` 0.5877
  recall@10, semantic-only) are still fully, mutually tied on every metric. Don't cite a single
  "best combo" among those four — the tie there is confirmed, not provisional. Hybrid still
  significantly beats dense-alone for essentially every one of the 9 embedders on every metric
  (still 26/27 tests significant — same count, but **the sole exception moved from `qwen3` on
  MRR to `qwen3_0.6b` on MRR**, Holm-adj p=0.30; `qwen3` is now significant on MRR too) — still
  the most robust finding of the comparison. Hybrid vs. BM25-alone shifted more: `qwen3_0.6b`,
  `qwen3`, `jina_v5`, `e5`, `bge-m3`, `e5_small` all significantly beat BM25 on recall@10 now
  (`jina_v5` newly clearly significant, was borderline before); `congen` dropped **out** of that
  group (BM25 itself got stronger post-OCR-fix, closing the gap); `sct`/`m2v` remain the
  cautionary cases where hybrid is significantly worse than BM25-alone, and **`sct`'s recall@10
  deficit is significant again** (reversing the 2026-07-25 "no longer significant, p=0.08"
  finding — that finding was itself measured against the since-superseded index). The
  cross-chunker **dense-alone 3-way tie at the top is broken**: `qwen3_0.6b` now significantly
  beats both `bge-m3` (+0.1173 recall@10) and `Qwen3-Embedding-4B` (+0.0486) in aggregate — this
  was always computed fresh (unaffected by the BM25/hybrid staleness bug), so it's a genuine
  finding, not an artifact. The per-entity_type specialist/weak-spot pattern underneath the old
  aggregate tie is **unaffected** by this (separate, already-fresh dense-alone test): `bge-m3` =
  person-query specialist, `Qwen3-4B` = only embedder with no provable weak spot across both
  main categories (ties bge-m3 on person AND ties ConGen/qwen3_0.6b on program), `Qwen3-0.6B` =
  now aggregate-leading but still has a real person-query weak spot `Qwen3-4B` doesn't,
  `ConGen-PhayaThaiBERT` = program-query specialist. BM25 alone (`retrievers/bm25.py`) no
  longer ties the top dense tier the way it used to — it now **significantly beats `bge-m3`**
  (aggregate recall@10 rose 0.3908→0.4930 post-OCR-fix, more than any embedder's own gain,
  because lexical matching is far more sensitive to OCR token corruption than dense embeddings)
  and still significantly beats every weaker embedder; it statistically ties only `qwen3` and
  `qwen3_0.6b` (and borderline-ties `jina_v5`, Holm-adj p=0.053). The per-chunker breakdown
  (`tools/eval/bm25_vs_embedder_significance_test_per_chunker.py`, re-run 2026-07-29) still
  shows `bge-m3` losing to BM25 significantly under `sentence` chunking specifically, and now
  additionally shows `qwen3_0.6b`'s numerically-negative BM25 margin under `semantic` chunking
  has become **statistically significant** (Holm-adj p=0.006) — the first cell in this whole
  comparison where an embedder significantly beats BM25 outright, reinforcing `semantic` as the
  one chunker where a strong dense embedder demonstrably earns its cost over free BM25. Don't
  naively RRF a weak embedder with BM25: `m2v` and `sct` both still significantly *hurt* vs. BM25
  alone on recall@10/MRR/nDCG@10 (all three, both models, post-refresh) — a real RRF failure
  mode whenever the fused dense signal is weak enough. Cost/latency:
  `tools/eval/cost_latency_pareto.py` (vector dim, index size, query latency p50/p95) found
  `HybridRetriever.retrieve()` and `BM25Retriever.retrieve()`'s current implementation
  (full-corpus `k=n` fetch before fusing, `BM25Okapi` rebuilt from scratch every query) adds a
  roughly **fixed ~2.1-2.3s of overhead to every hybrid query, nearly independent of embedder**
  (it scales with corpus size, not embedding dim) — the ~2.3-2.9s measured figure is mostly this
  avoidable per-query overhead on top of a ~130-730ms intrinsic cost, not RRF fusion itself;
  report at `data/results/cost_latency_pareto.md`.
